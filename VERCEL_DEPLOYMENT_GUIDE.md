# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## üö® Current Issue
Your deployed app shows `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` when trying to create new entries because the environment variables are not configured in Vercel.

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. **Go to your Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**
   - Go to **Settings** tab
   - Click on **Environment Variables** in the left sidebar

3. **Add the following variables:**

   **Variable 1:**
   - **Name:** `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://pmqeegdmcrktccszgbwu.supabase.co`
   - **Environment:** Production, Preview, Development
   - Click **Add**

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Name:** `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **Value:** `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InBtcWVlZ2RtY3JrdGNjc3pnYnd1Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTE5MDY1OTUsImV4cCI6MjA2NzQ4MjU5NX0.OqaYKbr2CcLd10JTdyy0IRawUPwW3KGCAbsPNThcCFM`
   - **Environment:** Production, Preview, Development
   - Click **Add**

### Step 2: Redeploy Your App

1. **Trigger a new deployment:**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click **Redeploy** on your latest deployment
   - Or push a new commit to your GitHub repository

2. **Wait for deployment to complete**
   - This usually takes 1-2 minutes

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. **Visit your deployed app**
2. **Try to create a new entry**
3. **Check if the error is resolved**

## üîß Additional Configuration

### SPA Routing (Already Fixed)
Your `vercel.json` file is already configured correctly for SPA routing:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

### Database Verification
‚úÖ Your Supabase database is working correctly:
- Connection: ‚úÖ Successful
- User types: ‚úÖ Present
- Users: ‚úÖ 4 users configured
- Tables: ‚úÖ All tables created

## üß™ Local Testing

To test locally before deploying:

1. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open http://localhost:5173**

3. **Test creating a new entry**

4. **Verify data is saved to Supabase**
