# Daily Report Cascading Filter Implementation

## Feature Request
The user requested that the Daily Report should have the same cascading filter functionality as the Edit Entry form - when you select a date, it should show only the company names that have entries on that specific date.

## Solution Implemented

### **Date-Based Company Filtering:**

The Daily Report now implements cascading filter functionality where selecting a date automatically updates the company dropdown to show only companies that have entries on that specific date.

### **Technical Implementation:**

1. **New Function: `loadCompaniesByDate`**
   ```typescript
   const loadCompaniesByDate = async (date: string) => {
     try {
       console.log('🔍 Loading companies for date:', date);
       
       // Clear company selection when date changes
       setSelectedCompany('');
       
       // Get all entries for the specific date
       const { data, error } = await supabase
         .from('cash_book')
         .select('company_name')
         .eq('c_date', date);

       if (error) {
         console.error('Error loading companies by date:', error);
         return;
       }

       // Extract unique company names
       const uniqueCompanies = [...new Set(data.map(entry => entry.company_name).filter(Boolean))];
       
       console.log(`📊 Found ${uniqueCompanies.length} companies for date ${date}:`, uniqueCompanies);
       
       // Update companies dropdown with date-specific options
       const companiesData = uniqueCompanies.map(name => ({
         value: name,
         label: name,
       }));
       setCompanies([{ value: '', label: 'All Companies' }, ...companiesData]);
       
       // Show toast with summary
       if (data.length > 0) {
         toast.success(`Found ${data.length} entries on ${date} with ${uniqueCompanies.length} companies: ${uniqueCompanies.join(', ')}`);
       } else {
         toast.info(`No entries found on ${date}`);
         // If no entries found, load all companies
         await loadCompanies();
       }
       
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error loading companies by date:', error);
       toast.error('Failed to load companies for selected date');
       // Fallback to loading all companies
       await loadCompanies();
     }
   };
   ```

2. **useEffect Hook for Date Changes**
   ```typescript
   // useEffect to load companies when date changes
   useEffect(() => {
     if (selectedDate) {
       console.log('🔄 Date changed, loading companies for date:', selectedDate);
       loadCompaniesByDate(selectedDate);
     }
   }, [selectedDate]);
   ```

3. **Enhanced Date Input Handler**
   ```typescript
   <input
     type='date'
     value={selectedDate}
     onChange={async (e) => {
       const newDate = e.target.value;
       setSelectedDate(newDate);
       // Clear company selection when date changes
       setSelectedCompany('');
       // Load companies for the new date
       await loadCompaniesByDate(newDate);
     }}
     className='w-full border border-gray-300 rounded-lg px-3 py-2 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500'
   />
   ```

4. **Enhanced Date Navigation**
   ```typescript
   const navigateDate = async (direction: 'prev' | 'next') => {
     const currentDate = new Date(selectedDate);
     const newDate =
       direction === 'prev' ? subDays(currentDate, 1) : addDays(currentDate, 1);
     const newDateString = format(newDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
     setSelectedDate(newDateString);
     // Clear company selection when date changes
     setSelectedCompany('');
     // Load companies for the new date
     await loadCompaniesByDate(newDateString);
   };
   ```

### **User Workflow:**

1. **Select Date** - User selects a specific date using the date input or navigation buttons
2. **Automatic Company Filtering** - System automatically loads only companies that have entries on that date
3. **Company Selection Clearing** - Previous company selection is cleared when date changes
4. **Related Options Update** - Company dropdown is populated with only relevant companies
5. **Comprehensive Feedback** - Toast shows summary of available companies and entries
6. **Easy Selection** - Users can select from filtered, relevant companies

### **Filter Clearing Logic:**

- **Date Change** → Clears Company selection and loads date-specific companies

### **Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Select Date "2024-01-15"**
- Toast: "Found 25 entries on 2024-01-15 with 3 companies: ABC Corp, XYZ Ltd, DEF Inc"
- Company dropdown shows only: "All Companies", "ABC Corp", "XYZ Ltd", "DEF Inc"
- Previous company selection is cleared

**Scenario 2: Select Date "2024-01-20"**
- Toast: "Found 12 entries on 2024-01-20 with 2 companies: ABC Corp, GHI Ltd"
- Company dropdown shows only: "All Companies", "ABC Corp", "GHI Ltd"
- Previous company selection is cleared

**Scenario 3: Select Date with No Entries**
- Toast: "No entries found on 2024-01-25"
- Company dropdown shows all companies (fallback to original behavior)
- Previous company selection is cleared

### **Database Query Logic:**

```sql
SELECT company_name 
FROM cash_book 
WHERE c_date = 'selected_date'
```

The query fetches all unique company names that have entries on the selected date, ensuring the dropdown only shows relevant options.

### **Benefits:**

1. **Intelligent Filtering** - Date selection automatically filters company options
2. **Data Validation** - Users can only select companies that have entries on the selected date
3. **Improved Efficiency** - No more selecting companies with no data for the date
4. **Better User Experience** - Automatic filtering reduces user effort
5. **Comprehensive Feedback** - Users see exactly what companies are available
6. **Consistent Behavior** - Same cascading behavior as Edit Entry form
7. **Fallback Handling** - Gracefully handles dates with no entries

### **Technical Features:**

- **Dynamic Query Building** - Queries are built based on selected date
- **Smart Filter Clearing** - Company selection is cleared when date changes
- **Efficient Database Queries** - Single query loads all relevant companies
- **Real-time Updates** - Company dropdown updates immediately when date changes
- **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of network and database errors
- **Fallback Mechanism** - Loads all companies if no entries found for the date

### **Integration Points:**

1. **Date Input Field** - Triggers cascading filter on change
2. **Date Navigation Buttons** - Previous/Next buttons trigger cascading filter
3. **useEffect Hook** - Automatically triggers when selectedDate changes
4. **Company Dropdown** - Updates with filtered options
5. **Toast Notifications** - Provides user feedback about available data

### **Error Handling:**

- **Network Errors** - Falls back to loading all companies
- **Database Errors** - Shows error toast and falls back to all companies
- **No Data Found** - Shows info toast and loads all companies
- **Invalid Dates** - Handles gracefully with fallback behavior

The cascading filter functionality is now fully implemented in the Daily Report! When you select a date, the company dropdown will automatically be populated with only the companies that have entries on that specific date, providing the same intelligent filtering experience as the Edit Entry form. 🎯
