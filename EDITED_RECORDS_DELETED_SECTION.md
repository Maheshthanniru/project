# 🗑️ Deleted Records in Edited Records Page - Enhanced

## ✅ **Issue Fixed!**

I've enhanced the Edited Records page to properly display deleted records in a prominent section. The page already had the functionality, but I've made it more visible and added better debugging.

## 🔧 **What I Enhanced:**

### **1. Enhanced Data Loading**
- Added automatic debug function call on page load
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Toast notifications for deleted records count

### **2. Improved Deleted Records Section**
- **More Prominent**: Added red border and better styling
- **Clear Header**: "🗑️ Deleted Records" with count badge
- **Action Buttons**: Debug and Refresh buttons
- **Better Empty State**: Clear message when no records found

### **3. Enhanced Debugging**
- Automatic debug on page load
- Manual debug button for troubleshooting
- Detailed console logging
- Better error messages

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **Page Structure:**
```
Edited Records Page
├── Edit Audit Log Section (existing)
└── Deleted Records Section (enhanced)
    ├── Header with count badge
    ├── Debug & Refresh buttons
    ├── Empty state (if no records)
    └── Table with deleted records
```

### **Data Flow:**
```
Page Load → Debug Database → Load Deleted Records → Display in Table
```
