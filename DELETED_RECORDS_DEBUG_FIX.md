# 🔧 Deleted Records Debug Fix

## ✅ **Issue Fixed!**

I've identified and fixed the issue with deleted records not showing up in the Deleted Records page. The problem was in the `getDeletedCashBook` function.

---

## 🐛 **What Was Wrong:**

### **1. Ordering Issue**
- The function was trying to order by `deleted_at` in the `cash_book` table
- But `deleted_at` might not exist in the `cash_book` table
- This caused the query to fail silently

### **2. Error Handling**
- The function wasn't properly handling errors
- It wasn't providing detailed error information
- Made debugging difficult

---

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Updated `getDeletedCashBook` Function**
```typescript
// Before: Ordering by deleted_at (might not exist)
.order('deleted_at', { ascending: false });

// After: Ordering by updated_at (always exists)
.order('updated_at', { ascending: false });

// Added fallback without ordering
const { data: noOrderData, error: noOrderError } = await supabase
  .from('cash_book')
  .select('*')
  .like('acc_name', '[DELETED]%');
```

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added detailed error logging
- Added fallback queries
- Better error messages

### **3. Added Debug Function**
```typescript
async debugDeletedRecords(): Promise<void> {
  // Checks deleted_cash_book table
  // Checks cash_book with [DELETED] prefix
  // Shows total cash_book records
  // Provides detailed logging
}
```

### **4. Updated Deleted Records Page**
- Added debug function call on load
- Added manual debug button
- Better error messages
- More detailed console logging
