# Fix Guide: Deleted Records Not Showing in Approve Records

## üö® Problem Description

Deleted records are not appearing in the Approve Records section, even though they exist in the database. This is preventing users from approving or rejecting deleted records.

## üîç Root Cause

The issue is caused by **missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies** for the `deleted_cash_book` table. Without proper RLS policies, users cannot access the deleted records, even though the table exists and contains data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

### Step 1: Run the Database Fix Script

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Navigate to your project
   - Go to **SQL Editor**

2. **Run the Fix Script**
   - Copy the entire content of `fix-deleted-records-complete.sql`
   - Paste it in the SQL Editor
   - Click **Run** to execute the script

3. **Verify the Fix**
   - The script will show you the current state
   - It will create the necessary RLS policies
   - It will verify that deleted records are now accessible

### Step 2: Test the Fix

1. **Run the Test Script**
   ```bash
   cd project
   node test-deleted-records-fix.js
   ```

2. **Check the Approve Records Page**
   - Open your application
   - Navigate to the Approve Records page
   - You should now see deleted records in the "Deleted Records" section

## üìã What the Fix Does

### 1. Creates RLS Policies
- **Read Access**: All authenticated users can read deleted records
- **Insert Access**: All authenticated users can insert deleted records (for deletion process)
- **Update Access**: Only admins can update deleted records (for approval process)
- **Delete Access**: Only admins can permanently delete from deleted_cash_book

### 2. Adds Missing Columns
- Adds `credit_online`, `credit_offline`, `debit_online`, `debit_offline` columns if missing
- Ensures table structure matches the main `cash_book` table

### 3. Verifies Access
- Tests that deleted records are now accessible
- Shows approval status distribution
- Confirms the ApproveRecords component can fetch deleted records

## üîß Technical Details

### RLS Policies Created

```sql
-- Allow all authenticated users to read deleted records
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read deleted cash book" ON deleted_cash_book
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);

-- Allow all authenticated users to insert deleted records
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert deleted cash book" ON deleted_cash_book
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow admins to update deleted records (for approval)
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update deleted cash book" ON deleted_cash_book
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users u 
      JOIN user_types ut ON u.user_type_id = ut.id
      WHERE u.id::text = auth.uid()::text AND ut.user_type = 'Admin'
    )
  );

-- Allow admins to delete from deleted_cash_book
CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete from deleted cash book" ON deleted_cash_book
  FOR DELETE TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users u 
      JOIN user_types ut ON u.user_type_id = ut.id
      WHERE u.id::text = auth.uid()::text AND ut.user_type = 'Admin'
    )
  );
```

### How ApproveRecords Component Works

1. **Fetches Deleted Records**: Uses `supabaseDB.getDeletedCashBook()` to get all deleted records
2. **Applies Filters**: Filters by date, company, and staff
3. **Shows Pending**: Only shows deleted records that haven't been approved yet
4. **Displays in Table**: Shows deleted records in a separate table below the main records

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Delete a Record**
   - Go to any page where you can delete records
   - Delete a record
   - Note the record details

2. **Check Approve Records**
   - Navigate to Approve Records page
   - Look for the "Deleted Records" section
   - Verify the deleted record appears

3. **Test Approval Process**
   - Try to approve/reject the deleted record
   - Verify the status changes correctly

### Automated Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
node test-deleted-records-fix.js
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied" error
**Solution**: Run the fix script to create RLS policies

### Issue: "Table doesn't exist" error
**Solution**: Run the main migration script first (`supabase/migrations/20250707174204_snowy_crystal.sql`)

### Issue: Deleted records still not showing
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify RLS policies were created successfully
3. Ensure you're logged in as an authenticated user

### Issue: Can't approve deleted records
**Solution**: Ensure you're logged in as an Admin user (not Operator)

## üìä Expected Results

After applying the fix:

- ‚úÖ Deleted records appear in Approve Records page
- ‚úÖ Users can see pending deleted records
- ‚úÖ Admins can approve/reject deleted records
- ‚úÖ Approval status is properly tracked
- ‚úÖ No permission errors in browser console

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Checks

1. **Monitor RLS Policies**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'deleted_cash_book';
   ```

2. **Check Deleted Records Count**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deleted_cash_book;
   ```

3. **Verify Approval Status Distribution**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     COUNT(*) as total,
     COUNT(CASE WHEN approved = true THEN 1 END) as approved,
     COUNT(CASE WHEN approved = false OR approved IS NULL THEN 1 END) as pending,
     COUNT(CASE WHEN approved = 'rejected' THEN 1 END) as rejected
   FROM deleted_cash_book;
   ```

## üìû Support
