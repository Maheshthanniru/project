# Auto-Navigation Fix for New Entry Form

## Problem
In the New Entry form, when selecting a company name from the dropdown, users had to manually hit Enter or Tab to move to the next field. This was inefficient for data entry workflows.

## Solution
Added auto-navigation functionality to the SearchableSelect component and New Entry form so that when a user selects an option from a dropdown, the focus automatically moves to the next field.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced SearchableSelect Component (`src/components/UI/SearchableSelect.tsx`)

**Added new prop:**
- `onSelect?: (value: string) => void` - Callback triggered when an option is selected

**Updated handleSelect function:**
- Now calls the `onSelect` callback after setting the value
- This allows parent components to handle auto-navigation

### 2. Updated New Entry Form (`src/pages/NewEntry.tsx`)

**Added auto-navigation for:**
- **Company Name → Main Account**: When company is selected, focus moves to Main Account field
- **Main Account → Sub Account**: When main account is selected, focus moves to Sub Account field
- **Dual Entry Company Name → Dual Main Account**: Same behavior for dual entry form
- **Dual Entry Main Account → Dual Sub Account**: Same behavior for dual entry form

**Implementation details:**
- Used `setTimeout` with 100ms delay to ensure the dropdown closes before focusing the next field
- Added proper ref checking to ensure the next field exists before focusing
- Maintained existing keyboard navigation (Enter/Tab) functionality

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
1. User clicks on Company Name dropdown
2. User selects a company
3. User must manually hit Enter or Tab to move to next field
4. Repeat for each dropdown selection

### After:
1. User clicks on Company Name dropdown
2. User selects a company
3. **Focus automatically moves to Main Account field**
4. User selects main account
5. **Focus automatically moves to Sub Account field**
6. Much faster data entry workflow!

## Technical Details

### Auto-Navigation Flow:
```
Company Name (select) → Main Account (select) → Sub Account → Particulars → Credit/Debit
```

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Automatic focus advancement** on dropdown selection
- ✅ **Maintains existing keyboard navigation** (Enter/Tab still work)
- ✅ **Works for both main and dual entry forms**
- ✅ **Proper timing** with 100ms delay to ensure smooth UX
- ✅ **Error handling** with ref existence checks
- ✅ **No breaking changes** to existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/UI/SearchableSelect.tsx` - Added onSelect callback support
2. `src/pages/NewEntry.tsx` - Added auto-navigation for company and account fields

## Testing

The auto-navigation can be tested by:
1. Opening the New Entry form
2. Clicking on Company Name dropdown
3. Selecting any company
4. Verifying that focus automatically moves to Main Account field
5. Selecting a main account
6. Verifying that focus automatically moves to Sub Account field

## Result

Users can now enter data much faster in the New Entry form without needing to manually navigate between fields after making dropdown selections. This significantly improves the data entry workflow efficiency.
